### Game instructions:

### This game is played on a three-by-three-square grid. You are X, and your friend is O. Each player takes turns placing their mark in an empty square. 
### The winner is the first player to get three of her markers in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally).

### Next Steps: It would be good to enhance this game so that you can play against the computer as a second player.
